# Benchmarking Pipeline for Enhancer Gene Links 

This repository seeks to serve as one out of three parts of a Comparison Pipeline spearheaded by the ENCODE Consortium. In this module, we seek to compare enhancer gene links with common disease variants attained from two sources: 
1. Fine-mapping inflammatory bowel disease loci to single-variant resolution (Huang et al 2017)
2. Fine-mapping in UK Biobank (Hilary Finucane et al): https://www.finucanelab.org/data

## Getting Started
1. Activate conda environment via : `conda create env -f abc-max.yml`


Example command:
```
bash log.sh $CODEDIR $OUTDIR
```
