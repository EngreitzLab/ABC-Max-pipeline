Test examples of code : 
The code runs with different settings depending on whether your predictions are enhancer regions, enhancer-gene regions or enhancer-gene regions in multiple celltypes

ABC : Enhancer-gene regions in multiple celltypes
BLUEPRINT_201217-ChromHMM : Enhancer regions in multiple celltypes
Granja2019 : Enhancer-gene regions in one celltype 

# Example code to run each of the different predictors located in example.py
